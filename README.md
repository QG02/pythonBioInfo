# ðŸ§¬ Rosalind Python Bioinformatics Problems

Welcome to my repository of Python solutions for bioinformatics challenges from [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/) â€” a platform designed to help learners master computational biology through problem-solving.

## ðŸ“š About Rosalind
Rosalind is a project focused on learning bioinformatics through hands-on practice. It provides a series of problems that gradually build your understanding of biology, algorithms, and programming. Problems range from DNA/RNA analysis to graph algorithms and genome assembly.

## ðŸ§ª What You'll Find Here
This repository contains my Python-based solutions, each one organized and documented. 

### âœ… Problem Categories Include:
- String Algorithms (e.g. DNA counting, GC content)
- Combinatorics
- Mendelian Genetics
- Population Dynamics
- RNA Splicing
- Phylogeny
- Genome Assembly
