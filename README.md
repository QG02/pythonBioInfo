# 🧬 Python Bioinformatics Problems

Welcome to my repository of Python solutions for bioinformatics challenges from [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/) — a platform designed to help learners master computational biology through problem-solving.

## 📚 About Rosalind
Rosalind is a project focused on learning bioinformatics through hands-on practice. It provides a series of problems that gradually build your understanding of biology, algorithms, and programming. Problems range from DNA/RNA analysis to graph algorithms and genome assembly.

## 🧪 What You'll Find Here
This repository contains my Python-based solutions, each one organized and documented. 
# DISCLAIMER 
Not all the projects from the webstie were solved according to the sample outputs provided. 
i.e. The first file in the folder "dnaCount.py" combines the 2 separate challenges "Counting DNA Nucleotides" and "Computing CG Content".

### ✅ Problem Categories Include:
- String Algorithms (e.g. DNA counting, GC content)
- Combinatorics
- Mendelian Genetics
- Population Dynamics
- RNA Splicing
- Phylogeny
- Genome Assembly
